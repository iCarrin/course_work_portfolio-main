### Elevator pitch

_Here we looked at the relationship between penguin's weight and the length of their flippers. Do there flippers grow with them, is there an optimal length that they grow to and stop, or is it completely random?_




### QUESTION|TASK 1

__chart from PY4DS: CH2 Data Visualization of the textbook__

_There is a clear upward trend. As the mass of the penguins increase so does the length of the flippers._



```{python}
LetsPlot.setup_html()
penguins = load_penguins()
(
    ggplot(
    data=penguins,
    mapping=aes(x='flipper_length_mm', y='body_mass_g')
    )
    +geom_point(aes(color='species', shape='species'))
    +geom_smooth(method='lm')
    +labs(
        title='Body mass and flipper length',
        subtitle='Dimenstions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins',
        x='Flipper Length (mm)',
        y='Body mass (g)',
        color='Species',
        shape='Species',
    )

)



```


_The data set the chart uses. There are many more mesurements to compare and contrast in the future.
```{python}
penguins.head()
```
